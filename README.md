# Metaweather app

Created an interface in which the user can search by name through the [Api](https://www.metaweather.com/api) and visualize in a list the information of each city and the average temperature of all the cities shown. You can also filter without the use of the Api by minimum and maximum temperature and by weather status using a selector that takes into account the cities displayed.

To run the project:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```


To run the tests, run:

```bash
npm test
```
